## What is a game jam?

A game jam is an event where people come together and build video games. 

A game jam can last something between a few hours and some weeks or month. I can be held as a local event or online.

A game jam starts with choosing and announcing a theme. Everybody can find people to cooperate with or choose to work on your own. Then working on the games start. People discuss game mechanics and stories, create sounds and graphics as assets and build up an idea, a prototype or a whole new game in a short amount of time. 

A game jam gives the opportunity to share your creations, receive feedback and may be vote for a kind of winner.

A game jam can have other rules or restriction like:
 * Only two buttons to control the game
 * Use game boy resolution and color pallet
 * All assets have to made exclusively during the jam

But despite all rules the most important gain of a game jam is working together, receiving constructive feedback, and have fun.
