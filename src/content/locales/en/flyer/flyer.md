A game jam is a gathering of people for the purpose of creating a game or a piece of interactive art in a short span of time. There's room for brainstorming and prototyping.<br><br>
Does this pique your interest? Are you not sure whether or not you can contribute? Yes you can!<br>
There's always something you can learn and pass on.<br>
To create a game, you don't just need software development, but also animation, graphics, sound and storytelling. If you have ideas or want to get inspired you will find like-minded people at the game jam to evolve these ideas.<br><br>
Participation is free! The Kuenstlerhaus that provides the room does welcome donations, however. You must be 18 or older to participate. More information and registration at https://game-jam-do.de
